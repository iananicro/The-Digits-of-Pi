    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>The idea for this website came around mid-March 2024. The very first version of the website started being wrote early in the morning on 23 March 2024.</p>
    <p>It was a fun idea, but it had to wait before I gave it more attention, as I needed to shift focus on to doing Final Projects for college and work on graduating.</p>
    <p>As the semester was wrapping up, I decided to tinker with the website again and I did some light work on it on 29 April 2024.<p>
    <p>Beginning in May, I really started to take the website more seriously, and transition it from an idea I tinkered with, to spending lots of time developing.
    <p>From 7 May to 13 May 2024, I focused on the site a lot more, and after approximately 15 - 20 hours of work, I finished the first version of the site on 13 May 2024.</p>
    <p>While I had fun with making this site, I also treated it is a project for myself to do to learn more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I can say that it was a fun and rewarding learning experience.</p>
