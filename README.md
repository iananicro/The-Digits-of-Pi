<a href="http://geocities.ws/thedigitsofpi/pi">thedigitsofpi</a> is a website that prints each digit of Pi (up to the 3 millionth digit).

Additionally, there is a Hardcore Mode with stricter parameters, which are...
- You must be fullscreened in-browser at 100% zoom. 
- If you leave fullscreen, the printing stops. 
- If you leave the page and go to another, the printing stops. 
- If you leave the page to go to another, the printing will stop. 

The goal behind Hardcore Mode is to lock the viewer in to a window where they can't do much other than view the page,
making the challenge to get the highest score before you break one of the parameters.

Additional features of the website include a light and night theme, as well as sound effects for each second passed while printing occurs.

About
-----
The Digits of Pi was a fun little idea I had in mid-March 2024.

I was finishing my final semester of college up until early-May 2024, at which point I focused on the website more and decided to turn it into a project for myself to improve my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

More serious development began around 7 May 2024, and concluded 23 May 2024, as I felt content with the state it was in and was worth uploading. The site was developed over the course of approximately 20 - 25 hours.

The launch of <a href="http://geocities.ws/thedigitsofpi/pi">thedigitsofpi</a> was on 3:16PM CST 23 May 2024.

I chose geocities to host the website because geocities is very for simple websites that anyone around the world can access. It allows me to share my website with other people with no risk of monetary loss if things don't work out. If I were to be very serious about the website, I would definitely chose a different way to host it, and with a custom domain name.

Future Features
---------------
If I do decide to continue developing this website, I do have some features that I would like to implement, such as...
- Leaderboards and Rankings
- Facts about Pi at certain positions
- More complex HTML design
- An 'About' page.
- Development Screenshots through time.
- Smooth between light and night mode.
