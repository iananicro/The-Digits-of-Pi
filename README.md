This repository is all of the files that make up a hypothetical website called 'The Digits of Pi'.

There are two different options for this website. Normal Mode and Hardcore Mode.

Normal Mode will print each digit of Pi (up to the 3 millionth decimal digit) one second at a time.

Hardcore Mode will also do this, but with much stricter perameters.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
You must be fullscreened in-browser at 100% zoom. 
If you leave fullscreen, the printing stops. 
If you leave the page and go to another, the printing stops. 
If you leave the page to go to another, the printing will stop. 

The goal behind hardcore mode is to lock the viewer in to a window where they can't do much other than view the page,
making the challenge to get the highest score before you break one of the parameters.
