Description
-----
The Digits of Pi is a hypothetical website that will print each digit of Pi (up to the 3 millionth digit).

Additionally, there is a Hardcore Mode with stricter param
- You must be fullscreened in-browser at 100% zoom. 
- If you leave fullscreen, the printing stops. 
- If you leave the page and go to another, the printing stops. 
- If you leave the page to go to another, the printing will stop. 

The goal behind hardcore mode is to lock the viewer in to a window where they can't do much other than view the page,
making the challenge to get the highest score before you break one of the parameters.

Additional features of the website include a light and night theme, as well as sound effects for each second passed while printing occurs.

About
-----
The Digits of Pi was a fun little idea I had in mid-March 2024.

I was finishing my final semester of college up until early-May 2024, at which point I focused on the website more and decided to turn it into a project for myself to improve my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

More serious development began around 7 May 2024, and over the course of approximately 20 - 25 hours, I developed the first version of the website that I am content with.

I am not sure whether or not I actually want to host the website right now, so I'm uploading it to GitHub because I like when software is open source and you can look in to it, plus I'm proud of it and would like to show it off.

Future Features
---------------
As it is, this site is just designed for fun and nothing serious, outside of a small website to refine some skills. If I do decide to continue developing this website, however, I do have some features that I would like to implement, such as...
- Leaderboards and Rankings
- Facts about Pi at certain positions
- More complex HTML design
- An 'About' page.
- Development Screenshots through time.
- Smooth between light and night mode.
